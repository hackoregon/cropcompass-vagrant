# HackOregon Crop Compass Vagrant Environment

0. Find a place with wall power and reliable network connectivity.
1. Install git, Vagrant and VirtualBox on your host machine.
2. Do:
```
git clone git@github.com:hackoregon/cropcompass-vagrant
cd cropcompass-vagrant
git checkout buildathon
```
3. Copy the `agtechdump2016-05-19.sql` dump file into `cropcompass-vagrant`. Then, on Windows, do `.\build.bat`. On MacOS or Linux, do `./build.bat`.

This will take some time.
